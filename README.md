# Decison-Tree-Classifier-on-a-drug-test
This dataset is consists of 200 data on drugs. I use decision tree classifier algorithm to predict the data. The data are divided into 
20% test and 80% train. After train the data with decision tree classifier it gives me 100% accuracy. the data are also compared with prediction
and actual value which were totally matched. The data are split using sklearn train test split package. I also manually calculate the accuracy
which gave me 100% accuracy as well. To better view of the result please see the pdf file attached to it.
